# Omission (Flatpak)

This is the official Flatpak packaging for [Omission](https://github.com/mousepawmedia/omission).

The manifest (.yaml file) in this repository may also be used as a model for packaging Kivy Python applications.

NOTE: This packaging currently only supports Intel/AMD architectures, due to a problem building the Kivy runtime dependency `mtdev` on aarch64. Pull requests welcome if you know how to fix that.
